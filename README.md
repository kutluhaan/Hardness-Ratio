# Hardness Ratio

The code in this repository can take the FITS files as input, modify the images inside the FITS files, and by dividing two image matrices of these images, it gives the hardness rait matrix and this matrix's visual projection. 

In this research, our purpose is to find the hardness ratio by comparing two photos taken by MIRI and NIRCam, which were obtained by MAST Archive, with different wavelengths in the same area of the space by using Python, Astropy  and other libraries. To make it, a code was written by using the Jupyter Notebook IDE. Additionally, Jupyter Notebook IDE is reached by Anaconda Navigator which also provides many other coding environments. 

In the Jupyter Notebook, FITS files are handled and the images inside of these files manipulated and modified in a way that hardness ratio could be obtained.

There are 6 parts in the code. Every part of the code is needed to be run in separate cells of the Jupyter Notebook.
